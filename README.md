#The Odin Project

##Google Homepage clone


##About this project

The objetive of this mini-project is to deconstruct Google's homepage and rebuild it. To do this I'll use Firefox's developer tools, by doing so I'll get to understand how the elements get placed on the page, how to style and align.

Even though this is not my first time writing a website html code, it is the first time using developer tools to see a website's html code.
